  "summary": "The diff implements most of the Igloo-style immersive healthcare transformation requirements. Major features include: immersive landing page with hero section, scroll-based navigation, cinematic sections with parallax, patient dashboard with glass morphism and Help Desk panel, doctor dashboard with mission control aesthetic and patient cards, comprehensive design system with charcoal/midnight blue and electric blue accents, and extensive micro-interactions. However, some specific details are missing or cannot be fully verified due to content truncation.",
