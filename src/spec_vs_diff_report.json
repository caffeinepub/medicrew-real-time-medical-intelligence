  "summary": "The implementation partially satisfies the BuildRequest. The keyboard shortcut hook (useAdminShortcut) is correctly implemented and wired in App.tsx. AdminDashboard validates roles and redirects unauthorized users with an 'Access Denied.' toast. However, critical requirements are missing: no evidence that visible Admin navigation links were removed from Header/sidebar, no implementation of smooth route transition animations specific to this feature, and no visible confirmation that the shortcut remains hidden (though no tooltips/indicators were added). The backend diff is truncated, preventing full verification of backend role validation logic.",

      "requirement": "Remove all visible Admin navigation links from Header component and any sidebar navigation for all user roles",
      "reason": "Header.tsx summary states 'without any visible Admin navigation links' but the actual diff content was not provided to verify removal of existing Admin links. Cannot confirm that Admin links were actively removed versus never existing.",

      "requirement": "Ensure keyboard shortcut implementation uses smooth route transition animations consistent with existing light medical theme design system",
      "reason": "No route transition animations or CSS transitions were implemented in the diff. The navigation in App.tsx uses setCurrentView('admin') with no animation code, and no transition styling was added to match the medical theme's 600ms+ ease-in-out animations.",
